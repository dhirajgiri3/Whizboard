Development Rules & Best Practices

Code Quality:
Use TypeScript exclusively (Cursor's type checking prevents any types).
Enforce ESLint/Prettier via Cursor's suggestions.
Follow atomic design for components.
Implement error boundaries (prompt Composer for error handling).


Performance:
Use lazy loading for routes/components (Cursor's suggestions).
Apply React.memo and useMemo (Cursor will suggest).
Debounce real-time updates.
Virtualize large datasets in canvas.


Real-Time Features:
Implement optimistic updates (Cursor's Apollo suggestions).
Use operational transformation for conflict resolution.
Handle network reconnection gracefully.
Apply rate limiting to subscriptions.


Security:
Validate/sanitize inputs (Cursor suggests libraries like sanitize-html).
Configure CORS in vercel.json.
Secure WebSocket connections.
