# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The header dropdown component's background blur effect is not working properly. Users expect a modern, polished glass-morphism effect with proper backdrop blur when the dropdown menu is open. The current implementation has inconsistent blur effects that may not work across all browsers or may have CSS specificity issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the header dropdown to have a consistent and visually appealing backdrop blur effect, so that the interface feels modern and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dropdown is opened THEN the system SHALL display a backdrop blur effect with consistent visual appearance
2. WHEN viewed on different browsers THEN the system SHALL maintain the same blur effect quality
3. WHEN the dropdown overlays content THEN the system SHALL apply proper glass-morphism styling with blur and transparency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backdrop blur implementation to be maintainable and consistent, so that it can be easily updated and reused across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing backdrop blur THEN the system SHALL use CSS classes instead of inline styles where possible
2. WHEN applying blur effects THEN the system SHALL include proper browser fallbacks for compatibility
3. WHEN styling dropdowns THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns that can be reused

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dropdown to have proper visual hierarchy and readability, so that I can easily interact with menu items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backdrop blur is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient contrast for text readability
2. WHEN hovering over menu items THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback
3. WHEN the dropdown is open THEN the system SHALL ensure proper z-index layering and visual separation from background content
